CODE BOOK 

-To decribe the Rows (Observations) and the Columns (Measurements) 
  in the tidyDataSet.csv product of the R-script.
  
  
OBSERVATIONS/ROWS:
subject- there are 30 subjects
activity- each subject engaged in 6 activities

Data below are collected for each of the 30 subjects as they participated in 
6 activities (so theres 6 rows per subject)
Means and Std Devs are listed only.
For further detail on whatever the hell each is, refer to UCI website.

MEASUREMENTS/COLUMNS:
